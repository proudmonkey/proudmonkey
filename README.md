### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Vince and I work as a Software Engineer in a research and development company, where we build products and services that impact the lives of millions of people. Iâ€™m very passionate about learning new technologies and ideas, I enjoy tackling challenges and sharing what I learned in the technical community through writing articles, books and answering to forums. I have over 15 years of software engineering experience - years of making mistakes and learning from them. A 10-time Microsoft MVP, 5-time C# Corner MVP, CodeProject MVP, MVA, MVA, OSS Contributor, Microsoft Influencer, DZone MVB and a regular contributor at various online technical communities.
